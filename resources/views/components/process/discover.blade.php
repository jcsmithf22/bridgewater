            We work closely with our clients to understand their
            <strong class="font-semibold text-neutral-950">needs</strong> and
            goals, embedding ourselves in their every day operations to understand
            what makes their business tick.

            Our team of private investigators shadow the company director’s for
            several weeks while our account managers focus on going through their
            trash. Our senior security experts then perform social engineering
            hacks to gain access to their
            <strong class="font-semibold text-neutral-950">business</strong>
            accounts — handing that information over to our forensic accounting
            team.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the full audit is complete, we report back with a comprehensive
            <strong class="font-semibold text-neutral-950">plan</strong> and,
            more importantly, a budget.
        </p>
